                <p>
                    On each round of this task, you will see a clock.
                    It takes 5 seconds for the hand of this clock to go the whole way around once.
                    Your task is to press the spacebar before it does in order to win
                    as many points as you can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The points you win on each round depend on where the hand is when you press the spacebar.
                    At some locations, you're very likely to win points.
                    At others, you're more likely to receive no points.
                    When this happens, you'll see an <b>âœ—</b> instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount of points you can win also depends on where the hand is.
                    At some locations, you'll score lots of points.
                    At others, you'll only score a few.
                    If you don't respond by the end of the clock cycle,
                    you don't get any points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll play with four different clocks,
                    and the good and bad locations will be different for each one.
                    You'll play 40 rounds with each clock.
                    The task will take 15 minutes in total.
                </p>
                <p>

                        Try to press the spacebar at different locations
                        in order to learn which area earns the most points!

                </p>

                    Note that the clock will always go around to the end,
                    no matter when you press the spacebar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Press the spacebar to begin.
