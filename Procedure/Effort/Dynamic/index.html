                    In this task, your job is to indicate, as quickly and as accurately as you can,
                    whether some digits you see on screen are odd, or even.
                </p>

                    On each round in this task,
                    you'll see a sequence of numbers, between 1 and 9, one at a time.
                    If the number is <em>odd</em>, press <code id="key-odd"></code>
                    on your keyboard.
                    If the number is <em>even</em>, press <code id="key-even"></code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's start with a demo version of the task.
                    Try to get all the numbers right, while still being as fast as possible.
                    If you get a digit wrong, it will turn red. Otherwise, it will turn green.
                </p>
                <p>Press <code>SPACE</code> for the first practice round.</p>

                    Great. You're now ready to practice the real task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From now on, the sequence of numbers won't be so predictable.
                    Your task is still to judge if the numbers are odd or even.
                    Remember to try to get all the numbers right, while still being as fast as possible.

                    You may have noticed that some of the sequences were more difficult than others.
                    At the start of every round from now on,
                    you'll see the difficulty level of the sequence coming up, from 20% (the easiest) to 80% (the hardest).
                    You'll also see the reward for successfully completing this sequence, from 1p to 4p.
                    This amount will be added to your bonus payment if you succesfully complete the sequence.
                    A sequence is marked as correct if you're correct for at least 9 of the 10 digits in the sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On each round, you're free to choose whether or not you want to
                    do the sequence and add to your bonus payment (by pressing <code>Y</code>),
                    or skip it and move on to the next round (by pressing <code>N</code>).
