                    In this task, your job is to indicate, as quickly and as accurately as you can,
                    whether some digits you see on screen are odd, or even.

                    On each round in this task,
                    you'll see a sequence of numbers, between 1 and 9, one at a time.
                    If the number is <em>odd</em>, press <code id="key-odd"></code>
                    on your keyboard.
                    If the number is <em>even</em>, press <code id="key-even"></code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's start with a demo version of the task.
                    Try to get all the numbers right, while still being as fast as possible.
                    If you get a digit wrong, it will turn red. Otherwise, it will turn green.
                </p>
                <p>Press <code>SPACE</code> for the first practice round.</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    From now on, the sequence of numbers won't be so predictable.
                    Your task is still to judge if the numbers are odd or even.
                    Remember to try to get all the numbers right, while still being as fast as possible.

                    You may have noticed that some of the sequences were more difficult than others.
                    At the start of every round from now on,
                    you'll see the difficulty level of the sequence coming up, from 20% (the easiest) to 80% (the hardest).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll also see the reward for successfully completing this sequence, from 1 to 4 points.
                    For every two points you score, 1p will be added to your bonus payment.
                    A sequence is marked as correct if you're correct for at least 9 of the 10 digits in the sequence.
                </p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                    There will also be a time limit from now on.
                    If you take too long on a sequence, it will be marked as incorrect.
                    Try to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On each round, you're free to choose whether or not you want to
                    do the sequence and add to your bonus payment (by pressing <code>Y</code>),
                    or skip it and move on to the next round (by pressing <code>N</code>).
