                <h2>Slot Machine Task</h2>
                <p>
                    In this task, you have a choice between two slot
                    machines, represented by colored buttons. When you
                    click one of the buttons, you will win or lose
                    points. Choosing the same slot machine will not
                    always give you the same points, but one slot
                    machine is always better than the other. Your goal
                    is to choose the slot machine that will give you
                    the most points. After making your choice, you
                    will receive feedback about the outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the machines are "safe" (always
                    delivering the same feedback), and sometimes the
                    machines are "risky" (delivering variable
                    feedback). Before you make a choice, you will get
                    information about each machine: "S" indicates
                    SAFE, "R" indicates RISKY. Note that safe/risky is
                    independent of how rewarding a machine is: a risky
                    machine may deliver more points on average than a
                    safe machine, and vice versa. You cannot predict
                    how good a machine is based on whether it is safe
                    or risky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will play 30 games, each with a different pair of slot machines.<br>
                    Each game will consist of 10 trials.
