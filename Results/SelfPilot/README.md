First
======

If working with data fresh off Gorilla,
you'll need to run `bash fix_nulls.sh`
to fix some minor formatting issues in the csv files.


Issues
=======

- Missed metrics from Reward Bias task after changing reinforcement schedule (fixed on Gorilla)
- Issues with data when connection lost (need to upload new version of primate.js)
